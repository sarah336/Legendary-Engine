ALSO ME! 
Hi, I am Sarah Jeffrey,and there's quite a bit of matter about me. 
My 2 children are called Laya (she's a lovely 5 year old and likes to have a lot of cat naps.) and then there is bubbles, (he's definitely not the brightest fish in the sea, but he has a lovely nature about him. The two of them really don't get along that well though.
